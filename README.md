### How to quantify the actor's success?

Welcome to our website! Check out our datastory :)

## Idea 
Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset, we want to dive into the drivers of an actor's success. Since the aspiration to become an actor is a dream for many, uncovering the factors or combinations of factors that contribute to an actor's accomplishment can provide valuable insights.

However, quantifying an actor's success is inherently subjective, because there are numerous ways to assess it. Some seek peer recognition through awards, others prioritize financial gains, positive ratings, public attendance, or long-lasting careers. Given these diverse goals we consider, the factors driving success may differ.

Through our analysis, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of what drives an actor’s accomplishments. Ultimately, we want to quantify the success of actors in our dataset and allow our readers to identify the attributes maximizing a specified success metrics.
