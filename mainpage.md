## Projet datacuisiniers : How to quantify the actors success ? ##
# Diving into the determinants of movie stars' accomplishments

# Abstract : #
Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset, we want to dive into the drivers of an actor's success. Since the aspiration to become an actor is a dream for many, uncovering the factors or combinations of factors that contribute to an actor's accomplishment can provide valuable insights.

However, quantifying an actor's success is inherently subjective, because there are numerous ways to assess it. Some seek peer recognition through awards, others prioritize financial gains, positive ratings, public attendance, or long-lasting careers. Given these diverse goals we consider, the factors driving success may differ.

Through our analysis, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of what drives an actorâ€™s accomplishments. Ultimately, we want to quantify the success of actors in our dataset and  allow our readers to identify the attributes maximizing a specified success metrics.

# Research questions : #
- What are the different ways to be successful and are they correlated?
- What drives these different dimensions of success?
- How much do personal characteristics matter (age, gender, height, etc)?
- How much do movie characteristics matter (genre, country, etc)?
- Do actors achieve success by making thoughtful decisions regarding their careers, such as diversifying the countries or languages to work in, or by strategically choosing the genres or personas they portray in movies?


# Proposed additional datasets : #
- [Oscars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award)
- [IMDb ratings](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
- Scraped data from [Google trends score](https://trends.google.com/trends/)
